It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings and seek support, and I commend you for taking this important step.  Based on your request for help managing everyday anxiety, here's a summary of helpful strategies:\n","\n","* **How to Cope with Anxiety: Actionable Tips - Healthline:**\n","\n","    * **Immediate Relief Techniques:**  When anxiety strikes, utilize quick coping mechanisms such as deep breathing exercises (many guided exercises are available online or through apps), grounding techniques (focus on your five senses or a 5-4-3-2-1 method), and progressive muscle relaxation to release physical tension.\n","\n","    * **Long-Term Management Strategies:**  Build a strong foundation for managing anxiety by incorporating regular exercise (even short walks help!), mindfulness and meditation practices (guided meditations are readily available), a healthy diet and sufficient sleep (7-9 hours), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques (consider professional guidance or explore online resources and apps).  Remember the importance of social support; connecting with loved ones provides comfort and perspective.\n","\n","* **How to Cope With Anxiety - Verywell Health:**\n","\n","    * **Validating Your Feelings:** It's crucial to remember that feeling anxious is a normal human emotion.

CBT helps identify and challenge negative thought patterns.  Social support from loved ones offers comfort and perspective.  If anxiety significantly impacts your daily life, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor is recommended.\n","\n","* **Living with Anxiety: Coping Strategies for Daily Life:**\n","\n","    * **Self-Compassion and Support:**  Acknowledge that you're not alone in your struggle with anxiety.  Reaching out is a significant step.  Remember that feeling anxious is a valid emotion, and it doesn't indicate anything inherently wrong with you.\n","\n","    * **Practical Strategies:**  Incorporate mindfulness and grounding techniques (deep breathing, sensory focus, progressive muscle relaxation), regular exercise (even gentle activities are beneficial), healthy lifestyle choices (sleep, nutrition\n","\n","📚 *References*:\n","How to Cope with Anxiety: Actionable Tips - Healthline:\n","https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/how-to-cope-with-anxiety\n","How to Cope With Anxiety - Verywell Health:\n","https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-deal-with-anxiety-8384822\n","Living with Anxiety: Coping Strategies for Daily Life:\n","https://healthaid.lemonaidhealth.com/anxiety/anxiety-coping-strategies/\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Backend.py file**"],"metadata":{"id":"lDNKNqLk3fkx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%writefile backend.py\n","# Paste all your backend code here\n","\n","from dotenv import load_dotenv\n","import os\n","import google.generativeai as genai\n","from duckduckgo_search import DDGS\n","from functools import lru_cache\n","import re\n","\n","# Load API key from .env\n","load_dotenv()\n","GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n","\n","# Configure Gemini\n","genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n","gemini_model = genai.GenerativeModel(\"models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest\")\n","\n","# DuckDuckGo Retriever\n","def DDGS_RAG(query, max_results=3):\n","    with DDGS() as ddgs:\n","        results = [\n","            r for r in ddgs.text(query, safesearch=\"on\", timelimit=\"y\", max_results=max_results)\n","        ]\n","    snippets = []\n","    for result in results:\n","        snippets.append({\n","            \"title\": result[\"title\"],\n","            \"body\": result[\"body\"],\n","            \"link\": result[\"href\"]\n","        })\n","    return snippets\n","\n","@lru_cache(maxsize=100)\n","def cached_DDGS_RAG(query, max_results=3):\n","    return DDGS_RAG(query, max_results)\n","\n","def clean_ddg_snippet(snippet):\n","    snippet = snippet.strip()\n","    snippet = snippet.replace(\"...\", \".\").replace(\"…\", \".\")\n","    snippet = re.sub(r'<.*?>', '', snippet)\n","    snippet = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', snippet)\n","    if snippet and not snippet[0].isupper():\n","        snippet = snippet[0].upper() + snippet[1:]\n","    return snippet\n","\n","def Gemini_generation(request, context):\n","    prompt = f\"\"\"\n","    You are an empathetic and caring psychological assistant.\n","    Your job is to understand people's problems deeply, validate their emotions,\n","    and offer thoughtful advice as a supportive personal therapist.\n","\n","    Context: {context}\n","    Request: {request}\n","\n","    Respond kindly and avoid sounding robotic.
